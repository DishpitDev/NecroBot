# NecroBot

NecroBot is a Discord engagement bot, initially built for the [DishpitDev Discord server](https://discord.gg/WYmXc7Y8sF).

It functions by assigning a 'Necromancer' role to the first chatter. If nobody speaks in genchat for at least ten minutes, the next person to speak can steal that role. The role unlocks access to a hidden channel, dubbed `graveyard`, where the user with the Necromancer role has full privileges: they can manage all messages, spam @everyone, delete messages, etc.

Currently built in python3.
